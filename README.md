# Svelter Game of Life

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Svelte.

## Introduction

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

## Rules

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.

2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.

4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelter-game-of-life
yarn
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.


## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can run the newly built app with `yarn start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).


## Single-page app mode

By default, sirv will only respond to requests that match files in `public`. This is to maximise compatibility with static fileservers, allowing you to deploy your app anywhere.

If you're building a single-page app (SPA) with multiple routes, sirv needs to be able to respond to requests for *any* path. You can make it so by editing the `"start"` command in package.json:

```js
"start": "sirv public --single"
```

## Deploying to the web

### With [now](https://zeit.co/now)

Install `now` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g now
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
cd public
now deploy --name my-project
```

As an alternative, use the [Now desktop client](https://zeit.co/download) and simply drag the unzipped project folder to the taskbar icon.

### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g surge
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
yarn build
surge public my-project.surge.sh
```
